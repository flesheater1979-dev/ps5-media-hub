/*
 * evo_updater.h - in-app self-update from GitHub releases (#120).
 *
 * Check the latest release, stream its .ffpfsc to a staging file beside the
 * installed image, verify the SHA-256 GitHub publishes for the asset, then swap
 * it in with one rename. Nothing is ever replaced before the hash matches, and
 * the user always has to say yes to each step.
 *
 * The download is streamed through FFmpeg's HTTP client (evo_avio_stream), so the
 * 22 MB image never sits in memory. The swap is the same handoff Nuvio Max'd uses
 * for an image install (verified copy, then one rename on the same filesystem);
 * the old image stays mounted under its open inode, so the running EVO is not
 * disturbed. The caller closes EVO afterwards and the user relaunches it.
 *
 * All calls are safe from the UI thread: the network work runs on its own thread
 * and evo_updater_get() only copies a snapshot.
